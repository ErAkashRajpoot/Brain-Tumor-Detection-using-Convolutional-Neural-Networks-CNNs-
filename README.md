# Brain Tumor Detection using CNN

## 📌 Overview
This project focuses on building a deep learning model to classify **brain MRI scans** into tumor and non-tumor categories.  
Using **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**, the model automates medical image analysis and assists in early detection of brain tumors.

## 🚀 Features
- Preprocessed MRI images (resizing, normalization, augmentation) for robust training  
- CNN architecture built with **TensorFlow/Keras**  
- Achieved **~92% accuracy** on test data  
- Optimized training with **early stopping and batch normalization**  
- Visualized training progress (loss & accuracy curves)

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Language**: Python  
- **Libraries**: TensorFlow, Keras, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, OpenCV  
- **Dataset**: Brain MRI scans (tumor vs non-tumor)

## 📊 Results
- **Accuracy**: ~92% on test set  
- **Improved generalization** by 15% using data augmentation techniques  
- Model outputs classification probabilities for each MRI image
